# Research Portfolio

My primary research focuses on rural health equity, health sociology, and quantitatively assessing the social determinants of health More specifically, I focus on how root causes of illness (i.e food insecurity) and barriers to care (i.e transportation and broadband access) intersect with rural geographies to produce health disparities. 

The following is meant to showcase a few projects -- it is not comprehensive. For a complete list, please visit my [ResearchGate Profile](httpss://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eashwar-Krishna).

## 🩺 Population Health & Health Equity

My work in this area investigates the structural and social factors that drive health disparities, with a specific focus on rural populations.

    * Oral presentation at the New England Rural Health Association Conference; Groton, CT.
    * This study develops and validates the Rural Adversity and Determinants Index (RADI), a novel composite SDOH index tailored for U.S. rural counties. RADI significantly outperformed SVI and RUCC across all outcomes.
      For premature mortality, RADI explained 55.6% of variance versus the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) (37.3%) and Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (2.4%); for poor/fair health, RADI reached 77.2% versus SVI (50.1%).

    * This study aims to quantify the relationship between CVD-related mortality and the availability of primary-care (PCP) and specialist providers in rural and non-rural areas of New England.
