Welcome to my personal site! I am a future physician and public health researcher passionate about achieving health equity for rural and underserved populations. My work focuses on using quantitative analysis and sociological frameworks to understand and address the social determinants of health. By engaging sociological theory in population health, I believe we can better expose barriers to equitable healthcare. I am preparing for entry into MD programs with a focus on health systems change. 

* I was awarded the inaugural Rural Student Leader Award (2025) from the New England Rural Health Association.
