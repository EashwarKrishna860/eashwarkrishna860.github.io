I am a future physician and public health researcher passionate about achieving health equity for rural and underserved populations preparing for entry into MD programs with a focus on health systems change. My work uses quantitative analysis and sociological frameworks to understand and address the social determinants of health. By engaging sociological theory in population health, I believe we can better expose barriers to equitable healthcare. Awarded the inaugural Rural Student Leader Award (2025) from the New England Rural Health Association.
